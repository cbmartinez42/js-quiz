# Description - JavaScript Quiz

This is an original application utilizing HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a short, timed quiz on JavaScript basics. 


Included in this application are:
* Utilized CSS grid boxes to align objects within the quiz
* Utilized JavaScript to create quiz functionality
    * Question items appear and are removed as answers are chosen
    * Question items change color according to whether they are right or wrong so the user can see if they answered correctly

Challenges I encountered
* This project was a challenge in multiple areas. In order to overcome these challenges, I used several methods to complete this working application:
    * I utilized multiple video tutorials from YouTube and Udemy, as well as other sites such as Stack Overflow, W3 Schools and MDN Web Docs
    * I took full advantage of my tutoring time, getting as far as I could on my own and having the areas where I needed assistance ready when my scheduled tutoring time approached
    * I took every opportunity during office hours, both before and after class, each day to ask questions, get feedback and listen and watch others' questions in order to further my knowledge
